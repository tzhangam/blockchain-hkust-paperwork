\author{Pengshu}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
My dear teammates, we have now pinned down to two candidate topics for our blockchain-hkust project, which are automobile sharing and peer-to-peer house services. To proceed we need more information about both topics, and please formulate the info you collected into a report like this, so that we can discuss the ideas and build upon them efficiently. I will specify the coverage of materials I expect you to gather, as well as what discussion and proposal you should make, in the following sections.

\end{itemize}


\section{The description of the business}
\begin{itemize}
