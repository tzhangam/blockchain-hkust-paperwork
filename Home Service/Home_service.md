# Home services 
tag: shared economy, P2P solution

## Topic
A platform, like Airbnb, enables housekeepers, or family members to hire people to do temporary home services for them. Job nature can be:

> 1. Temporary: within one day for majority, serveral hours perhaps
> 2. Payment: in a digital way that can be recorded on Blockchain
> 3. Verification: required, in a way that can be traced, and recorded in blockchain
> 4. Location: undefined, can be mobile
> 5. Evaluation: recommended, and will be recorded in blcochain

## Involved entities
Basic model: *Empolyer* hires a *Temporary worker* to complete a *task*, which is _temporary_ and requires certain _skills_ perhaps.

## General Process (enhanced by blockchain)
Referring to Airbnb case mentioned by the report of `Goldman Sachs`, the process can be inducted and modified.

- Booking: Documents verified by government, not by the third party; *Verified* evaluations can be checked on blockchain to help choose the deal
- Payment: Secure storage of payment credentials tied to ID; Funds released per fulfillment of *smart contract* terms; Payment on digital coins can be considered to ensure privacy
- Reviews: Review is not accepted unless digitally signed by reviewer; Review must be validated by historical paid transactions; Reviews can be traced and do not disappear

## Issues with blockchain solution: Privacy concerns
One of the greatest obstacles to the adoption of blockchain
in this context is the perception of a loss of consumer privacy. In effect, a blockchain-based system would aggregate the user’s *ID, payment information, reputation, past transaction history, and reviews*. It is noticeable that this is already commonly done across current range of home service platforms (`58家政`, `阿姨帮`) in a far less secure way (simple password control). However, users could have concerns about a distributed database that stores their sensitive personal and financial information. *Ultimately, the strong level of underlying security with a blockchain-based solution would minimize these objections over time.*

It can be expected that a blockchain-enhanced solution, with appropriate methods adopted from *cryptography* would be superior than current _O2O_ and _P2P_ solutions. Or perhaps make the platform only have the access to verification (a T/F boolean and basic info such as location instead of detailed IDs.

## Brief market analysis
//Open to correction and completion
> 1. Need: in high demand, especially under the context of aging-society in China
> 2. Temporary worker: high quality wanted
> 3. Trust: highly desired
> 4. Leader: no giant in this area, only `58家政` is *quasi-famous*, with link in `WeChat` wallet
